The prognosis and severity kidney cancer is assessed upon AJCC (TNM) staging system &nbsp;where it determines the severity of the cancer by grading over three factors: (T) the size of the tumor, (N) the presence and the extent of cancer appearing in the lymph nodes, (M) and the presence of the cancer metastasizing to other organs in the body.
