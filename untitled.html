The prognosis and severity kidney cancer is assessed upon AJCC (TNM) staging system &nbsp;where it determines the severity of the cancer by grading over three factors: (T) the size of the tumor, (N) the presence and the extent of cancer appearing in the lymph nodes, (M) and the presence of the cancer metastasizing to other organs in the body. Medical and clinical researchers are interested in looking interested in looking these predictors which affect kidney cancer metastasis due to the increasing rate  of incidence and mortality for this disease&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Gandaglia_2014}</cite>.

On the other hand, for the metastatic kidney cancer patients query used "C77 Secondary and unspecified malignant neoplasm of lymph nodes, "C78 Secondary malignant neoplasm of respiratory and digestive organs," and "C79 Secondary malignant neoplasm of other and unspecified sites" ICD10 codes to identify a sample size of&nbsp;N = 1108 patients.
